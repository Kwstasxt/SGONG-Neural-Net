# SGONG-Neural-Net

Android Application that's uses Machine Learning. The method that is being used is the neural network SGONG(Self-Growing and Self Organized Neural Gas)  which is a mixture that consists of the neural networks Kohonen SOFM and Growing Neural Gas(GNG). This neural network has the main advantage which is to find and maintain only the dominant colors within an image. This is accomplished by training neurons that represent the values of colors in RGB colorspace. The method that it is being used  for sampling is random for the input vectors values. There were taken into account more than three features that they are used by default and they are the data sets of Red, Green and Blue values from RGB colorspace. Additional features were included and these are the feature of Median, Gradient, Contrast, Sobel, and LBP.
